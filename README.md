<p class="p4">In addition, the Provider is obliged to inform all recipients to whom data has been disclosed by the Provider about any correction or deletion of data or restriction of processing that takes place on the basis of Articles 16, 17 (1), 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not exist insofar as this notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Notwithstanding the above, the user has a right to information about these recipients.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b>Likewise, users and data subjects have the right to object to the future processing of data concerning them in accordance with Art. 21 GDPR, insofar as the data is processed by the provider in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.

<p class="p8"><b>Contract processing</b></p>
<p class="p8">The data provided by you in order to make use of our range of goods and/or services will be processed by us for the purpose of processing the contract and are necessary to this extent. Conclusion and processing of the contract are not possible without the provision of your data.</p>

<p class="p8">We delete the data with complete contract execution, but must observe the retention periods under tax and commercial law.</p>
<p class="p8">In the context of contract processing, we pass on your data to the transport company commissioned with the delivery of goods or to the financial service provider, insofar as the transfer is necessary for the delivery of goods or for payment purposes.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>Google Analytics with IP anonymization (Google Inc.).</b></p>
<p class="p8">In our app, we use Google Analytics. This is a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland, hereinafter only referred to as "Google".</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">The Google Analytics service is used to analyze the usage behavior of our app. The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest lies in the analysis, optimization and economic operation of our app.</p>
<p class="p4">Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, location, time or frequency of visits to our website, is transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, we use Google Analytics with the so-called anonymization function. Through this function, Google already shortens the IP address within the EU or EEA.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">The data collected in this way is in turn used by Google to provide us with an evaluation of the visit to our website and the usage activities there. This data may also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and the use of the Internet.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Google states that it will not associate your IP address with any other data. In addition, Google keeps a record of your IP address at</p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s3"><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners">https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/partners</a></span></p>
<p class="p4">Google provides you with further information on data protection law, including information on how to prevent the use of your data.</p>
<p class="p3"><br></p>
<p class="p4">Google also offers an opt-out function, which is activated by default in the app. This means that the app has already activated IP anonymization when it is started for the first time. However, this setting can be changed in the settings if desired.</p>
<p class="p4">However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or to other web analytics services. If and which other web analytics services are used by us, you will of course also find out in this privacy policy.</p>

<p class="p8"><b>How the rights can be exercised</b></p>
<p class="p8">All requests to exercise the User Rights may be addressed to the Provider via the contact details provided in this document. Requests can be exercised free of charge and will be processed by the Provider as soon as possible, at the latest within one month.</p>
